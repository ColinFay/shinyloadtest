[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rstudio/shinyloadtest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rstudio/shinyloadtest)

WIP.

This package extends the [shinytest package](https://github.com/rstudio/shinytest) to enable users to load test deployed Shiny applications. Load testing is executed using parallel phantomJS sessions.
